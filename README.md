# Cybersecurity-Repository


## Introduction

I first became interested in cybersecurity during my time in the United States Air Force, where I served as an Electronic Warfare technician. While my primary responsibilities did not focus directly on cybersecurity, I was exposed to the field through coworkers who had completed cybersecurity certification courses. Hearing terms like "steganography", "botnets", and "password cracking" sparked my curiosity and pushed me to explore security beyond my original role. That initial exposure ultimately set me on a new professional path and solidified my decision to pursue cybersecurity as a career.


## CTF Reflection

In Fall 2025, I participated in my first Capture the Flag (CTF) competition. The experience was both challenging and eye-opening, as it quickly highlighted gaps in my hands-on experience with red teaming tools and methodologies. At the same time, the competition reinforced foundational concepts I had already learned and showed me how they apply in realistic problem-solving scenarios.

Overall, the CTF experience motivated me to continue developing my technical skills and deepen my understanding across multiple areas of cybersecurity. It shifted my mindset from purely theoretical learning to practical application and continuous improvement.


## CTF Highlights

- Gained hands-on exposure to real-world cybersecurity problem-solving under time constraints  
- Strengthened my understanding of red team concepts, tools, and methodologies  
- Improved my ability to analyze unfamiliar challenges and identify effective solution paths  
- Developed greater confidence in applying learned concepts in practical scenarios
